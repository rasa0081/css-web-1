                    <p>The term "Japanese domestic market" ("JDM") refers to Japan's home market for vehicles and vehicle parts.[1] Japanese owners contend with a strict motor vehicle inspection and grey markets. JDM is also used as a term colloquially to refer to cars produced in Japan but sold in other countries. JDM does not necessarily refer to the market that the vehicle is destined for. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_domestic_market">read more...</a></p>

                    <p>The legendary Skyline, first introduced in 1957, was originally built by Japan’s Prince Motor Company. Production of the Prince Skyline lasted from 1957 until 1966, when Prince and Nissan merged. With humble origins as a rather modest 4-door luxury car, the Skyline began to evolve into a performance-bred sportscar following the merger. Today the Skyline is most recognized as the influential predecessor to the modern GT-R. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Skyline_GT-R">read more...</a></p>

                    <p>Any search for the soul of the Mazda brand leads you directly back to the RX-7 coupe. Launched in 1978, just as punk rock shockers the Sex Pistols began their final U.S. tour, the RX-7 had a similarly robust disregard for established principles. Instead of powering its brand new two-door coupe by any conventional in-line or V-shaped engine, Mazda’s management decided that a Wankel rotary engine was the most interesting and efficient way to achieve the swift performance and deft handling it wanted. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7">read more...</a></p>
